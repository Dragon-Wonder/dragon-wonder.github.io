# Dragon-Wonder's Github Pages

This website is a simple GH page that provides links to some of the repositories I have worked on. 

I am also part of the [Dragon Wonder Organization](https://github.com/Dragon-Wonder), which is just myself and a friend working together on some projects.

## List of Projects

* [Physics Collision Simulator](https://github.com/Dragon-Wonder/Physics-Collision-Simulator)
	* Physics simulator that simulates balls colliding, and bouncing off each other. Configurable allowing different physics options to be set. 
* [GH Page for project](https://dragon-wonder.github.io/Physics-Collision-Simulator)
* [Experimental Platformer AI](https://github.com/Dragon-Wonder/Experimental-Platformer-AI)
	* A simple platformer game that was designed to test using a generational AI that "learns" how to play the game. Mostly developed to test AI capabilities, but there is also a setting that allows a human player mode.
